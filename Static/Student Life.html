            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For international students, the Malaysian visa requirements and procedures are not difficult. 
                For the first phase, students need to provide a valid passport, photo, academic records, IELTS/TOEFL certificate, 
                offer letter from the university, filled-out visa application form, as well as medical examination forms which are done in 
                the student’s country of origin. The approval process will take less than a month and the letter will be received in digital format. 
                Later, students can start planning to travel to Malaysia. At the airport, the printed version of the approval letter should be shown to the 
                officer at the immigration counter. A temporary pass which is valid for 2 weeks will be stamped in the student’s passport. 
                Students should seek help from their university’s international office to continue with the visa application process during these 2 weeks. 
                Students are also required to carry out medical examinations in certain hospitals.

            <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Malaysia offers a wide selection of courses to study that fits a wide range of budgets. 
                Studying at a private university tends to be far less expensive with a range of USD 8,600 ' to USD 11,400 for a 3-year business degree and 
                a range of USD 62,900 to USD 108,600 for Medicine over 3 years.
                In contrast, the price range for a 3-year business degree at a foreign university campus would be around USD 13,700 to USD 24,000. 
                For a medical degree, the fees would be about USD 114,300 over 5 years. These figures vary according to the university and change on a annual basis. 
                Visiting the website of the university will provide more insight into the costs.

            <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The price for accommodation in Malaysia is rather fair. 
                For on-campus accommodation, students can choose from different room or unit types. 
                For example, at Monash University, students had two options. In type one, they have the chance of living alone while paying a higher price. 
                Each room has an individual washroom as well as a cooking area. The second type have a lower price with 8 students living in one unit (each person living in a separate room). 
                The washrooms were shared and a cooking area is provided. These accommodations tend to cost between USD 100 – 250 a month.
                Off-campus accommodation provides a wider range of living options at a slightly higher price. 
                In Kuala Lumpur, townhouses are rented to groups of students who would split the total cost. Rooms may also be individually rented out. 
                These townhouses usually share a kitchen and common area. Students also have the option to live in hostels, where there are dorms or shared rooms at a lower price. 
                Utilities are not included in off-campus rentals but can be negotiated with the landlord. Students can expect to pay around USD 150 and above per month, with an additional USD 30-50 for utilities.

            <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are many ethnic groups living in Malaysia which consists mainly of Malays, Chinese and Indians. 
                As a result, the food is extremely diverse as well. Foods and delicacies such as Nasi Lemak, Curry Laksa, Fried Rice, 
                Nasi Briyani, Roti Canai, Maggi Goreng, and Satay are the favorites among both local and foreign students. 
                Students also enjoy desserts such as Kaya Pau, Rojak or Kuih. 
                Most universities provide students with a shared kitchen where light meals are prepared. 
                Besides the option of cooking, KL is full of stalls, restaurants and food courts where students can purchase their daily meals at a very low cost. 
                The monthly budget for groceries would be about USD 100 per month.

            <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In some universities, students may be required to purchase textbooks for their studies. 
                Students can often get discounts by purchasing from publishers or buying second-hand textbooks from upperclassmen. 
                These will often be listed on student forums or social media groups. 
                Some textbooks may sometimes be found in the library of universities which are available for loan at no additional cost.
