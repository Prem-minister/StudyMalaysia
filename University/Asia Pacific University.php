                <h2>Students Experience & Activities</h2>
                <p>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;Student Services at APU aims to provide support, assistance, advice, consultation, and
                    essential services to all APU students and to cater to the well-being
                    of students beyond their academic needs. It is a one-stop centre where questions about APU courses,
                    policies, procedures, services and events can be obtained.
                    We provide on-campus and off-campus accommodation within guarded environments, while students are
                    exposed to clubs, societies, and special interest groups on-campus.<br><br>

                    &nbsp;&nbsp;To ensure that our students get the best out of their life at APU, we offer personal
                    counselling services geared towards helping them with academic concerns
                    as well as emotional matters. All counselling is done in a safe and confidential environment by
                    qualified counsellors.<br><br>

                    &nbsp;&nbsp;APU Career Centre connects our students with over 10,000 potential employers to provide
                    internship and job opportunities.
                    Annually, they organize Mega Career Fairs on campus as well as career talks to help students equip
                    themselves with necessary employability skills.
                    Professionalism is our philosophy, where students are exposed towards workplace ethics and
                    professional code of conducts on-campus.
                    The campus simulates a real-life working environment, allowing students to adapt to the professional
                    working environment even before they graduate.<br><br>

                    <img src="APU_16.jpg" alt=apu-16 style="float:right;">

                    &nbsp;&nbsp;At APU, students are exposed towards our core values: Technology & Innovation,
                    Professional Development, Multiculturalism and Cultural Diversity.<br><br>

                    &nbsp;&nbsp;While teaching and learning processes pay focus on practical learning experience,
                    innovative thinking is stimulated among students of all programmes,
                    encouraging them to think outside the box and to solve the world's biggest problems. The
                    multicultural experience at APU is spectacular - with students from over
                    130 countries studying on-campus, both local and international students are exposed to the amazing
                    experience of cultural exchange and interactions that are happening on a daily basis.<br><br>

                    <img src="APU_17.jpg" alt=apu-17 style="float:left;">

                    &nbsp;&nbsp;Teaching and learning facilities are redesigned to suit the needs of the industry, in
                    line with the Industrial Revolution 4.0, a strong emphasis on cooperative learning
                    is reflected at APU's new iconic campus, through the abundance of communal spaces and discussion
                    areas, where aspiring young minds come together to formulate innovative ideas.
                    Wings spreading out from the Spine offer creative spaces intended to foster self-directed learning
                    and teaching. Highly conducive teaching & learning spaces, study lounges, studios,
                    laboratories, tutorial rooms, breakout rooms and syndicate rooms sit alongside modern, fully
                    equipped lecture theatres where core knowledge is taught by well qualified academics.
                    All spaces are carefully designed to create an unforgettable learning and lifestyle experience that
                    lasts for a lifetime, while enabling professional learning and cultivating global mindsets.
